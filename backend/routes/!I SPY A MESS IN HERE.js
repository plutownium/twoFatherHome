// shouldnt it be like, "CRUD for Chatrooms is all in the chatroom.js file"? It isn't the case rn. the D is in a del.js file.
// user CRUD = user.js?
// chatRoom CRUD = chatroom.js?
// matchmaker CRUD = matchmaker.js?
// admin tools = admin.js? route universal CRUD thru admin.js so only admins can make admin lvl changes? yes?
